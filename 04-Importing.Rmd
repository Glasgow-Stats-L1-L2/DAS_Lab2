# Importing spreadsheets into R {-}

Up to this point, we've been using data stored inside of an R package.  In the real world, your data will usually come from a spreadsheet file either on your computer or online.  Spreadsheet data is often saved in one of two formats:

* A *Comma Separated Values* `.csv` file.  You can think of a CSV file as a bare-bones spreadsheet where:
    + Each line in the file corresponds to one row of data/one observation.
    + Values for each line are separated with commas. In other words, the values of different variables are separated by commas.
    + The first line is often, but not always, a *header* row indicating the names of the columns/variables.
* An Excel `.xlsx` file. This format is based on Microsoft's proprietary Excel software. As opposed to a bare-bones `.csv` files, `.xlsx` Excel files contain a lot of *metadata*, i.e. data about the data. Examples include the use of bold and italic fonts, colored cells, different column widths, and formula macros etc.

[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) allows you to download your data in both comma separated values `.csv` and Excel `.xlsx` formats: Go to the Google Sheets menu bar -> File -> Download as -> Select "Microsoft Excel" or "Comma-separated values".

We'll cover two methods for importing data in R: one using the R console and the other using RStudio's graphical interface. 

### Method 1: From the console {-}

First, let's download a *Comma Separated Values* (CSV) file of ratings of the level of democracy in different countries spanning 1952 to 1992: <https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv>. We use the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package to read it off the web and then take a look.

```{r message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(readr)
dem_score <- read_csv("https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv")
dem_score
```

In this `dem_score` data frame, the minimum value of -10 corresponds to a highly autocratic nation whereas a value of 10 corresponds to a highly democratic nation.

### Method 2: Using RStudio's interface {-}

Let's read in the same data saved in Excel format this time at <https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.xlsx>, but using RStudio's graphical interface instead of via the R console. First download the Excel file, then go to the Files pane of RStudio -> Navigate to the directory where your downloaded `dem_score.xlsx` is saved -> Click on `dem_score.xlsx` -> Click "Import Dataset..." -> Click "Import Dataset..." At this point you should see an image like in 

```{r readexcelfig, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = "400px", fig.pos="h"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/read_excel.png",dpi = 700)
```

After clicking on the "Import" button on the bottom right RStudio save this spreadsheet's data in a data frame called `dem_score` and display its contents in the spreadsheet viewer. Furthermore you'll see the code that read in your data in the console; you can copy and paste this code to reload your data again later instead of repeating the above manual process.

**Task**
Read in the life expectancy data stored at https://moderndive.com/data/le_mess.csv, either using the console below or using RStudio's interface.

```{r Task4-solution, webex.hide="Solution", echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
life_exp_scores <- read_csv("https://moderndive.com/data/le_mess.csv")
head(life_exp_scores)
```
