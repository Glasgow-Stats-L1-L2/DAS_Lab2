When looking at the `flights` data set, there are some clear additional variables that could be calculated based on the values of variables already in the data set.  Passengers are often frustrated when their flights departs late, but change their mood a bit if pilots can make up some time during the flight to get them to their destination close to when they expected to land.  This is commonly referred to as "gain" and we will create this variable using the `mutate` function.  

```{r}
flights <- flights %>% 
  mutate(gain = dep_delay - arr_delay)
```
Note that the `mutate()` command outputs a new data frame consisting of the original data frame with the addition of the new variable `gain`, which then replaces the original `flights` data frame.

Let's take a look at `dep_delay`, `arr_delay`, and the resulting `gain` variables for the first 5 rows in our new `flights` data frame using some new `dplyr` functions, namely `select()` and `slice()`:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
flights %>% 
  select(dep_delay, arr_delay, gain) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

The flight in the first row departed 2 minutes late but arrived 11 minutes late, so its "gained time in the air" is actually a loss of 9 minutes, hence its `gain` is `-9`. Contrast this to the flight in the fourth row which departed a minute early (`dep_delay` of `-1`) but arrived 18 minutes early (`arr_delay` of `-18`), so its "gained time in the air" is 17 minutes, hence its `gain` is `+17`.

Why did we overwrite `flights` instead of assigning the resulting data frame to a new object, like `flights_with_gain`? As a rough rule of thumb, as long as you are not losing information that you might need later, it's acceptable practice to overwrite data frames.  However, if you overwrite existing variables and/or change the observational units, recovering the original information might prove difficult. In this case, it might make sense to create a new data object.

Let's look at summary measures of this `gain` variable and plot it in the form of a histogram:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gain_summary <- flights %>% 
  summarize(
    min = min(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    q1 = quantile(gain, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
    median = quantile(gain, 0.5, na.rm = TRUE),
    q3 = quantile(gain, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE),
    max = max(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean = mean(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    missing = sum(is.na(gain))
  )
gain_summary
```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
gain_summary <- flights %>% 
  summarize(
    min = min(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    q1 = quantile(gain, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
    median = quantile(gain, 0.5, na.rm = TRUE),
    q3 = quantile(gain, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE),
    max = max(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean = mean(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(gain, na.rm = TRUE),
    missing = sum(is.na(gain))
  )
kable(gain_summary)
```

We've recreated the `summary` function we saw in Week 1 here using the `summarize` function in `dplyr`.

```{r message=FALSE, fig.cap="Histogram of gain variable", fig.align = "center" }
ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = gain)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "skyblue", bins = 20)
```

We can also create multiple columns at once and even refer to columns that were just created in a new column.

```{r}
flights <- flights %>% 
  mutate(
    gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
    hours = air_time / 60,
    gain_per_hour = gain / hours
  )
flights %>% 
  select(gain, hours, gain_per_hour) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

**Task**
What do positive values of the `gain` variable in `flights` correspond to?  What about negative values?  And what about a zero value?

`r hide("Solution")`
Say a flight departed 20 minutes late, i.e. `dep_delay = 20` then arrived 10 minutes late, i.e. `arr_delay = 10`.
   + Then `gain = dep_delay - arr_delay = 20 - 10  = 10` is positive,
so it "made up/gained time in the air".
   + 0 means the departure and arrival delays were the same, so no time was made up in the air.
   
We see in most cases that the `gain` is near 0 minutes.
`r unhide()`

**Task**
Could we create the `dep_delay` and `arr_delay` columns by simply subtracting `dep_time` from `sched_dep_time` and similarly for arrivals?  Try the code out and explain any differences between the result and what actually appears in `flights`.

`r hide("Solution")`
No because you can't do direct arithmetic on times. 
The difference in time between  12:03 and 11:59 is 4 minutes, but `1203-1159 = 44`
`r unhide()`

**Task**
What can we say about the distribution of `gain`?  Describe it in a few sentences using the plot and the `gain_summary` data frame values.

`r hide("Solution")`
* Most of the time the gain is between -25 and 25 minutes.
* There are some extreme cases however, e.g. `min(flights$gain, na.rm=T)` returns -196 and `max(flights$gain, na.rm=T)` returns 109.
