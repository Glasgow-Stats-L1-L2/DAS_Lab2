# Group rows using `group_by` {-}

```{r groupsummarize, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.pos="h"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/group_summary.png")
```

It's often of interest to summarize a variable based on the groupings of another variable.  Let's say, for example, we are interested in the mean and standard deviation of temperatures *in each month*. We can produce this by running the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary_monthly_temp <- weather %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
            std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE))
summary_monthly_temp
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary_monthly_temp <- weather %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
            std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE))
kable(summary_monthly_temp)
```

This code is identical to the previous code that created `summary_temp`, with an extra `group_by(month)` added. Grouping the `weather` data set by `month` and then passing this new data frame into `summarize` yields a data frame that shows the mean and standard deviation of  temperature for each month in New York City. Note: Since each row in `summary_monthly_temp` represents a summary of different rows in `weather`, the observational units have changed.

It is important to note that `group_by` doesn't change the data frame. It sets *meta-data* (data about the data), specifically the group structure of the data. It is only after we apply the `summarize` function that the data frame changes. 

If we would like to remove this group structure meta-data, we can pipe the resulting data frame into the `ungroup()` function. For example, say the group structure meta-data is set to be by month via `group_by(month)`, all future summaries will be reported on a month-by-month basis. If however, we would like to no longer have this and have all summaries be for all data in a single group (in this case over the entire year of 2013), then pipe the data frame in question through and `ungroup()` to remove this.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary_monthly_temp <- weather %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
            std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE))
summary_monthly_temp
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary_monthly_temp <- weather %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
            std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE))
kable(summary_monthly_temp)
```

We now revisit the `n()` counting summary function we introduced in the previous section. For example, suppose we'd like to get a sense for how many flights departed each of the three airports in New York City:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
by_origin <- flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
by_origin
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
by_origin <- flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
kable(by_origin)
```

We see that Newark (`"EWR"`) had the most flights departing in 2013 followed by `"JFK"` and lastly by LaGuardia (`"LGA"`). Note there is a subtle but important difference between `sum()` and `n()`. While `sum()` simply adds up a large set of numbers, the latter counts the number of times each of many different values occur. 

### Grouping by more than one variable {-}

You are not limited to grouping by one variable! Say you wanted to know the number of flights leaving each of the three New York City airports *for each month*, we can also group by a second variable `month`: `group_by(origin, month)`.

```{r}
by_origin_monthly <- flights %>% 
  group_by(origin, month) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
by_origin_monthly
```

We see there are 36 rows to `by_origin_monthly` because there are 12 months times 3 airports (`EWR`, `JFK`, and `LGA`). Let's now pose two questions. First, what if we reverse the order of the grouping i.e. we `group_by(month, origin)`?

```{r}
by_monthly_origin <- flights %>% 
  group_by(month, origin) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
by_monthly_origin
```

In `by_monthly_origin` the `month` column is now first and the rows are sorted by `month` instead of origin. If you compare the values of `count` in `by_origin_monthly` and `by_monthly_origin` using the `View()` function, you'll see that the values are actually the same, just presented in a different order. 

Second, why do we `group_by(origin, month)` and not `group_by(origin)` and then `group_by(month)`? Let's investigate:

```{r}
by_origin_monthly_incorrect <- flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
by_origin_monthly_incorrect
```

What happened here is that the second `group_by(month)` overrode the first `group_by(origin)`, so that in the end we are only grouping by `month`. The lesson here, is if you want to `group_by()` two or more variables, you should include all these variables in a single `group_by()` function call.

**Task**
Recall from Week 1 when we looked at plots of temperatures by months in NYC. What does the standard deviation column in the `summary_monthly_temp` data frame tell us about temperatures in New York City throughout the year?

`r hide("Solution")`
The standard deviation is a quantification of spread or variability.

We see that the period in November, December, and January has the most variation in weather, so you can expect very different temperatures on different days.
`r unhide()`

<br>

**Task**
Write code to produce the mean and standard deviation temperature for each day in 2013 for NYC?

`r hide("Hint")`
Make sure to `group_by` the appropriate variables first, before `summarize`ing the mean and standard deviation.
`r unhide()`

```{r Task10-solution, webex.hide="Solution", echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
summary_temp_by_day <- weather %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
            std_dev = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE))
summary_temp_by_day
```

<br>

**Task**
Recreate `by_monthly_origin`, but instead of grouping via `group_by(origin, month)`, group variables in a different order `group_by(month, origin)`. What differs in the resulting data set?

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r Task11-solution, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
by_monthly_origin <- flights %>% 
  group_by(month, origin) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
by_monthly_origin
```

The difference is they are organized/sorted by `month` first, then `origin`
`r unhide()`

<br>

**Task**
How could we identify how many flights left each of the three airports for each `carrier`?

`r hide("Hint")`
Summarize the count from each airport using the `n()` function, which *counts rows*.
`r unhide()`

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r Task12-solution, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
count_flights_by_airport <- flights %>% 
  group_by(origin, carrier) %>% 
  summarize(count=n())
count_flights_by_airport
```

Note: the `n()` function counts rows, whereas the `sum(VARIABLE_NAME)` function sums all values of a certain numerical variable `VARIABLE_NAME`.
`r unhide()`

<br>

**Task**
How does the `filter` operation differ from a `group_by` followed by a `summarize`?

`r hide("Solution")`
`filter()` picks out rows from the original data set without modifying them, whereas `group_by %>% summarize` computes summaries of numerical variables, and hence reports new values.
`r unhide()`
