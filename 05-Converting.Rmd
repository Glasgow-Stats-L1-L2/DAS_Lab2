# Converting to "tidy" data format {-}

```{r reshape, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.pos="h"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/reshape.png")
```

In this Section, we'll see how to convert a data set that isn't in "tidy" format (but rather is in ["wide"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) format), to a data set that is in "tidy" format (or equivalently ["long/narrow"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data#Narrow) format). Let's use the `dem_score` data frame we loaded from a spreadsheet in the previous Section but focus on only data corresponding to the country of Guatemala.

```{r }
guat_dem <- dem_score %>% 
  filter(country == "Guatemala")  
guat_dem
```

Now let's produce a plot showing how the democracy scores have changed over the 40 years from 1952 to 1992 for Guatemala.  Let's start by laying out how we would map our aesthetics to variables in the data frame:

- The `data` frame is `guat_dem` so we use `data = guat_dem`

We'd like to see how the democracy score has changed over the years in Guatemala.  But we have a problem.  We see that we have a variable named `country` but its only value is `"Guatemala"`.  We have other variables denoted by different year values.  Unfortunately, we've run into a data set that is not in the appropriate format to apply the Grammar of Graphics and `ggplot2`.  Remember that `ggplot2` is a package in the `tidyverse` and, thus, needs data to be in a tidy format.  We'd like to finish off our mapping of aesthetics to variables by doing something like 

- The `aes`thetic mapping is set by `aes(x = year, y = democracy_score)`

but this is not possible with our wide-formatted data. We need to take the values of the current column names in `guat_dem` (aside from `country`) and convert them into a new variable that will act as a key called `year`.  Then, we'd like to take the numbers on the inside of the table and turn them into a column that will act as values called `democracy_score`.  Our resulting data frame will have three columns:  `country`, `year`, and `democracy_score`.

The `gather()` function in the `tidyr` package can complete this task for us.  The first argument to `gather()`, just as with `ggplot2()`, is the `data` argument where we specify which data frame we would like to tidy.  The next two arguments to `gather()` are `key` and `value`, which specify what we'd like to call the new columns that convert our wide data into long format.  Lastly, we include a specification for variables we'd like to NOT include in this tidying process using a `-`.

```{r}
guat_tidy <- gather(data = guat_dem, 
                    key = year,
                    value = democracy_score,
                    - country) 
guat_tidy
```

We can now create the plot to show how the democracy score of Guatemala changed from 1952 to 1992 using a linegraph and `ggplot2`.

```{r errors=TRUE}
ggplot(data = guat_tidy, mapping = aes(x = year, y = democracy_score)) +
  geom_line()
```

Observe that the `year` variable in `guat_tidy` is stored as a character vector since we had to circumvent the naming rules in R by adding backticks around the different year columns in `guat_dem`.  This is leading to `ggplot` not knowing exactly how to plot a line using a categorical variable.  We can fix this by using the `parse_number()` function in the `readr` package and then specify the horizontal axis label to be `"year"`:

```{r guatline, fig.cap="Guatemala's democracy score ratings from 1952 to 1992"}
ggplot(data = guat_tidy, mapping = aes(x = parse_number(year), y = democracy_score)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "year")
```

We'll see later how we could use the `mutate()` function to change `year` to be a numeric variable instead of after we have done our tidying.  Notice now that the mappings of aesthetics to variables make sense in the figure:

- The `data` frame is `guat_tidy` by setting `data = guat_tidy`
- The `x` `aes`thetic is mapped to `year`
- The `y` `aes`thetic is mapped to `democracy_score`
- The `geom_`etry chosen is `line`

**Task**
Convert the `dem_score` data frame into a tidy data frame and assign the name of `dem_score_tidy` to the resulting long-formatted data frame.

`r hide("Hint")`
Use the `gather` function and think carefully about what each argument should be.
`r unhide()`

```{r Task5-solution, webex.hide="Solution", echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
dem_score_tidy <- gather(data = dem_score, 
                    key = year,
                    value = democracy_score,
                     -country) 
head(dem_score_tidy)
```

**Task**
Convert the life expectancy data set you created above into a tidy data frame.

`r hide("Hint")`
Again, use the `gather` function.
`r unhide()`

```{r Task6-solution, webex.hide="Solution", echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
life_exp_scores <- read_csv("https://moderndive.com/data/le_mess.csv")

life_exp_tidy <- gather(data = life_exp_scores, 
                    key = year,
                    value = life_exp,
                     -country) 
head(life_exp_tidy)
```
